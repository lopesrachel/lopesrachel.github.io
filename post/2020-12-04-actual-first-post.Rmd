This is my first post!

```{R}
library(reticulate)
print("Here's an R chunk!")
```


In python, you can create data structures called 'dictionaries'. Dictionaries allowed you to store a 'key' and pair it with one or more 'values'. Although unordered, it is possible to extract a value or values associated with a key. In the following python code chunk, I have provided an example of a dictionary.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

#create dictionary
departments = {'Natural Sciences': 'Biology', 'Natural Sciences': 'Chemistry', 'Business': 'MIS', 'Liberal Arts': 'English'}

print(departments)
#As is apparent from this example, if a key is paired with multiple values, the last value it is paired #with will override any previous values it was paired with.

# To associate multiple values with a key, you must initialize some sort of object holder such as a list
# within the dictionary, and then it will be able to associate multiple values with a key.
#example:
songs_in_playlist = {'Taylor Swift': ['mirrorball', 'Christmas Tree Farm'], 'Taemin' : 'Think of You', 'Maggie Rogers' : ['Color Song']}
print(songs_in_playlist) #before song added
songs_in_playlist['Maggie Rogers'].append('Alaska') #add song to any category with object holder
print(songs_in_playlist) #after song added

#let's loop through the artists!
for key in songs_in_playlist:
  print(key)
  print(songs_in_playlist[key])
  
new_df = {'lane1' : [12, 23, 14, 16, 15], 'lane2' : [16, 21, 7, 17, 14], 'lane3' : [7, 15, 10, 10, 20]}
df = pd.DataFrame(new_df)
```

Now, let's move on to R:

```{R}
#here's the dataframe from the python code:
df_in_r <- py$df
print(df_in_r) #print out dataframe
hist(df_in_r$lane1) #graphing a column of the dataframe as a histogram

```

Hello and goodbye from the Alaskan Highway!
