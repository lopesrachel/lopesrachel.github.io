```{R}
library(reticulate)

print("Here's an R code chunk.")
li <- c(3, 12, 4, 16, 17)
print(li)

```


In python, you can create data structures called 'dictionaries'. Dictionaries allowed you to store a 'key' and pair it with one or more 'values'. Although unordered, it is possible to extract a value or values associated with a key. In the following python code chunk, I have provided an example of a dictionary.

```{python}

#create dictionary
departments = {'Natural Sciences': 'Biology', 'Natural Sciences': 'Chemistry', 'Business': 'MIS', 'Liberal Arts': 'English'}

print(departments)
#As is apparent from this example, if a key is paired with multiple values, the last value it is paired #with will override any previous values it was paired with.

# To associate multiple values with a key, you must initialize some sort of object holder such as a list
# within the dictionary, and then it will be able to associate multiple values with a key.
#example:
songs_in_playlist = {'Taylor Swift': ['mirrorball', 'Christmas Tree Farm'], 'Taemin' : 'Think of You', 'Maggie Rogers' : ['Color Song']}
print(songs_in_playlist) #before song added
songs_in_playlist['Maggie Rogers'].append('Alaska') #add song to any category with object holder
print(songs_in_playlist) #after song added

#let's loop through the artists!
for key in songs_in_playlist:
  print(key)
  print(songs_in_playlist[key])
  
```
